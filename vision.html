    <p>From a life considered to be  a waste of time...</p>
    <p>To a life worth living to prove yourself and show your worth...</p>
    <p>From a life full of mistakes and regrets to be taken as a lesson…</p>
    <p>To live a life to make changes, be better and be the best of yourself… </p>
    <p>From a life lived underwhelming yourself…</p>
    <p>To a life making your family proud and to be optimistic…</p>
    <p>A life to remain as a memorable one! A life to pass away as a content one!</p>

  <p>I hope you get all you cherish and long for in life. My prayers are all with you everyday and my arms are always open for you, for both the good and bad! </p>

  <div>
    <p>From the bad that breaks us two,</p>
    <p>To the good that makes us one,</p>
    <p>Let it do its deed…</p>
    <p>Two souls as one…Two spirits as love…</p>
    <p>In the end, we are nothing…</p>
    <p>Nothing but one longing for another, </p>
    <p>In the name of Love! </p>

  <p>I hope you see me as family one day, because when you leave home, you seek fortune and once you get it, you come back home to share it with your family… Relationships might end, but families don’t!</p>
    
  <div>
    <p>I might be feeding you all the future to make you anxious, 
      But I am also feeding in all the hope you might have lost…
      I might be stuffing you with restricted thoughts,
      I might be reminding you of the things which won’t change in the present, 
      But all I intend to do is to show you what it could be…
      You say you need more time,
      But you never know if you will get more time because life is the most unpredictable,
      what else would make life interesting then?
      This isn’t meant to be misunderstood as a breaking call,
      But to be understood as an emotional one!
      I would love you regardless of what you consider me as… I would love you regardless of how much you hate me or love me… I would be there with you even if you push me away and I would be there with you every morning and night… 
      </p>
      <p>To the gods that brought us together, I pray that we stay together forever…</p>
