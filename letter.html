  <h1>Tejasvi Senka</h1>
  <p id="start">To the love of my life,</p> 
  <div id="body">
    <p>
      Days have passed with both good and bad. There were times when we had amazing conversations, staying up all night on calls, not wanting to hang up. I remember our unforgettable moments at school, our minds always thinking of each other. I’d call you to study, but really, I just couldn’t stand being apart from you. I almost tripped and broke my nose when you first said, “Love ya,” because it made my heart race. We’ve come a long way, but the bad times can’t be ignored. There were moments when we exhausted each other, times when you wanted to leave and I begged you to stay, feeling like my life depended on it. Desperation sometimes turns into anger, and you find peace these days by avoiding me. You doubted if I was the one for you, and I still don’t have the answer but I hope you do, now or soon. But despite it all, our love endures. It’s what keeps bringing us back together, no matter what happens</p>
    </p>
    <p>I know life hasn't always been kind to you, and I may have played a part in that. But please understand, I hold nothing against you. My heart and mind just can't stay silent when I see you doing something that needs to be addressed. Still, I am afraid... Afraid that my care is causing you pain, that my love might make you resent me, that my presence might be overwhelming you. I fear waking up one day to find you gone from my life, and that thought terrifies me more than anything. I can't imagine a life without you, and I would rather face anything than lose you.</p>
    <p>Life is bland and incomplete without you Tejasvi… It is more incomplete and problematic without you in front of my eyes… I think about you every sunrise and sunset. The thought of you leaving me breaks me down thinking of life without you. Life is too plain to live just for the success I manifest without you. Long distance is a sadistic existence but a test of true love. I’ve made plenty of mistakes but I don’t think this is one… You are everything I need and you complete me. I am the luckiest man alive to have a woman like we you and I love you for every breath I take and I have done so since the day you loved me. I would have never thought in my wildest dreams that I’d be a person of love or a person with a fear of losing someone. I don’t expect anything back in return for this or all I do… All I expect is you to stay with me and hold on to me and trust me, I will make sure you will not regret it! I love you so much Tejasvi, and no I don’t expect you to love me back as I do either. I need you to be there with me to hug me tight when I lose hope but also need you to be there with me to kiss me and smile when I win. I need you to be with me forever and ever. Ask me anything and I will do it for our best, but please don’t ask me to leave you!</p>
    <p>I want to be with you under each other’s security in real life, but most importantly I need you to be there with me regardless. I want to kiss you and hug you everyday as I promised but I also want to love you with all my heart. I want to travel with you to experience life as solely one but I pray to god you will be there with me for every moment in my life. I want to sleep with you like a baby like I said I would under your heat and sweat but I also need to be the man you will ever need in your life. I want to have sex with you, suffocating each other letting our hormones and desperation do the talk, but I need us to be together for each other even when life takes a coin flip. I want to grow old with you, knowing we never gave up on each other, fixed each other, knew each other and to be remembered by the world as one of the greatest loves to ever exist. 
    </p>
    <p>For the years to come, I want you to be my best friend I never had, a mother I will miss, a bossy sister I wished I had, a wife I will soon have, a part of my family, and finally my baby I can live with regardless of what comes against us. I love you Tejasvi Senka, let us not give up on each other! Hold on to me and I will never hurt you for it! Trust me and be for me! 
    </p>

  <p id="footer">I hope I am not a regret to you Tejasvi, I am literally a kolandha to you... and I lose it sometimes! Please don't regret this or consider this as a burden! I also hope you didn't mean it when you told saying yes to me was a mistake...
